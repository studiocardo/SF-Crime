# SF-Crime
Notebook, data, output of the SF Crime project

## View it with Safari, Firefox!!

This notebook displays bokeh plots that use GMap, which currently **do not play nice with Chrome**.  Please **view it with Safari, Firefox or modern browsers.**

This is the repository for the notebook, which contains the source code and the plots (some of them).  For best viewing experience, please:

1. copy the url of the notebook
2. go to nbviewer.jupyter.org
3. paste the URL in nbviewer.jupyter.org

The notebook uses bokeh for all visual outputs (some of them are interactive), which can cause some problem for github (you have to reload the notebook).  So pls use nbviewer.jupyter.org.
